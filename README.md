## Run Locally

    1. You must install a lightweight server such as VS Code's extension "Live Server" in order to view
    the file found in "/views/index.html". This is due to many browsers apply the "Same Origin Policy(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy)" to local files which disallows them from loading files that are located in the same directory as the file. This is an issue as the HTML file depends on external files within the same directory.
